	<p style "width=400px">Hello World, I'm Nicki. I'm nine months out of college and a new Bostonian. I work at Libboo, a publishing startup in Cambridge where our mission is to help talented authors get their work discovered by understanding and utilizing their biggest advocates. I work as a UX/UI/graphic designer and brand strategist. I want to learn front-end development skills so that a)I can communicate more effectively with the development team, and b)I can avoid the frustration of only being able to create flat designs that don't actually function. I have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS and I'm hoping to expand on what I know and grow into a killer web designer.
